60
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:08,488
There's also an orange-like camera thing in -- in the room that is like inside.

61
00:03:09,656 --> 00:03:10,156
(That room).

62
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,226
(But) -- but I kinda am, kinda confused.

63
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:18,031
((sneezes))

64
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:18,965
Thank you.

65
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:20,066
Thanks.

66
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:21,301
Ugh, wow.

67
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:22,202
Hm.

68
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:29,876
Ooh.

69
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:33,813
Ah, you got like squeezed ... to death.

70
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,515
Sorry about that.

71
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,417
Ugh.

72
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:38,785
Let me try.

73
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:41,354
How does it work, how does it work?

74
00:03:44,324 --> 00:03:44,524
Okay.

75
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,025
Oh.

76
00:03:47,927 --> 00:03:50,163
Can I please try inside to -- to see?

77
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,266
Like, can you stand on this?

78
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:55,435
Wait, wait.

79
00:03:56,936 --> 00:03:57,237
Cool.

80
00:03:59,339 --> 00:03:59,939
Uh.

81
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,708
Don't know what it means.

82
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:06,279
Can you stand on this to let me through for --

83
00:04:06,946 --> 00:04:07,847
Oh, thanks.

84
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,617
And uh, yeah.

85
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,020
And uh --

86
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:18,691
Can -- can you stand on that one?

87
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,560
Oh, I'm really confused right now.

88
00:04:20,893 --> 00:04:22,595
How does the portal thing work?

89
00:04:22,729 --> 00:04:23,029
I --

90
00:04:24,864 --> 00:04:26,532
There's the primary (portal) --

91
00:04:26,532 --> 00:04:27,200
Oh!

92
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:29,102
Oh.

93
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,037
Ah.

94
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,805
Oh, look.

95
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:33,673
If we like --

96
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:34,774
Wait.

97
00:04:36,075 --> 00:04:38,344
This the ... secondary portal.

98
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:43,049
Wait, I right-clicked my mouse and this comes the purple thing.

99
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:44,817
Did -- did you see the purple thing there?

100
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:48,721
Yeah, I -- I -- I don't know how it works.

101
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:49,989
I don't know why it works.

102
00:04:50,156 --> 00:04:50,790
It's just --

103
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,526
I got the portal stuff.

104
00:04:54,427 --> 00:04:58,398
And I don't know how ... it's going to help us.

105
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:00,333
Uh.

106
00:05:10,009 --> 00:05:10,476
Oof.

107
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:14,814
Oh, I see.

108
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:20,453
I think we can only open portals in this kind of -- in this kind of materials.

109
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:23,022
So if I go something like this kind of --

110
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:24,824
Yeah () see that.

111
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:25,725
That's cool.

112
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:29,762
So we can only put our portal on this kind of like porous material.

113
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:30,496
So if I go --

114
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:32,065
Ah.

115
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:32,899
That's cool.

116
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,133
That's cool.

117
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:37,103
And uh I can go -- I can go to that place.

118
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,238
Yeah, and uh --

119
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,442
Yeah, you stay inside, uh you stay inside and uh--

120
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,379
Oh wait, let -- let -- let me think how -- how we -- we should do this.

121
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,613
Yeah, cool.

122
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:51,784
So, uh can -- how -- how do I get the portal?

123
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:52,919
Okay, I see, I see.

124
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,421
So maybe you can go to the other side uh.

125
00:05:56,489 --> 00:05:57,657
And uh stay there.

126
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,326
Go to like the -- the -- the room with the like --

127
00:06:01,828 --> 00:06:02,895
That -- that one.

128
00:06:04,664 --> 00:06:05,631
The room over there.

129
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:07,367
Yeah yeah yeah.

130
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:07,900
Yeah, sure.

131
00:06:08,401 --> 00:06:08,735
Definitely.

132
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:09,902
You can also use the portal.

133
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,804
Ah, oops.

134
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:12,305
Yeah.

135
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,273
And uh --

136
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:15,274
Cool.

137
00:06:16,976 --> 00:06:17,110
Cool.

138
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:19,078
Cool.

139
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:20,346
And --

140
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,815
Oh, I know.

141
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:22,915
Ah.

142
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:23,850
Damn.

143
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:24,817
Uh.

144
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,785
Okay, uh.

145
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:26,519
I know, I know, I know.

146
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,221
So ... uh here's the thing.

147
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:32,425
Yeah, and uh also put a portal, like, here, alright?

148
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,694
Put a portal, like, somewhere here.

149
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:35,928
Like, in -- in my room.

150
00:06:36,195 --> 00:06:36,929
I'll let you through.

151
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,665
Put a portal in my room that connects to your like --

152
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:40,500
Yeah.

153
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,934
You can just put the --

154
00:06:42,502 --> 00:06:43,503
Yeah, and uh --

155
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:44,670
Cool.

156
00:06:45,638 --> 00:06:48,975
Yeah, you can get out and uh ... put a portal, say, here.

157
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:51,077
Put your other (portal) --

158
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,145
Yeah, and uh --

159
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:53,546
Cool.

160
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,313
And we can get through.

161
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:56,783
Cool.

162
00:06:56,783 --> 00:06:57,650
And I think uh --

163
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,789
And uh let’s come -- yeah, we got through.

164
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:03,423
We got through.

165
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:04,357
Cool.

166
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:05,925
So it takes two.

167
00:07:07,193 --> 00:07:10,263
Yeah, and we can proceed to the next level.

168
00:07:10,296 --> 00:07:11,764
I think that means ().

169
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:12,565
Yeah, cool.

170
00:07:13,466 --> 00:07:13,900
Nice job.

171
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:16,035
Okay, this is the --

172
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:22,141
Hm.

173
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:26,846
Yeah!
