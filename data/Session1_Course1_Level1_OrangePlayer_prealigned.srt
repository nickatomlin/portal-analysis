Alright.

13
00:00:48,415 --> 00:00:49,916
I (accidentally filled this out) (). 

14
00:00:49,983 --> 00:00:50,550
That's totally fine.

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:50,784
Okay.

16
00:00:51,117 --> 00:00:51,718
Alright, thank you.

Thank you.

19
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:57,023
Hello.

20
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:18,645
Yeah.

21
00:01:19,045 --> 00:01:19,446
Can you hear me?

22
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:20,814
Alright.

23
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:25,452
Mm.

24
00:01:27,053 --> 00:01:27,253
Oh.

25
00:01:29,622 --> 00:01:30,123
I suppose.

26
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,631
I put the () in here.

27
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:41,034
()

28
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:46,306
Where are you?

29
00:01:49,042 --> 00:01:49,776
()

30
00:01:52,145 --> 00:01:53,546
()

31
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:06,593
Oh.

32
00:02:06,926 --> 00:02:07,193
Sorry.

33
00:02:14,167 --> 00:02:14,734
Alright then.

34
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:48,434
Oh, I have an idea.

35
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:50,270
Maybe. 

36
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:55,542
There's this ... ah orange thing on camera.

37
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,012
Does that have to hit somewhere perhaps?

38
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:04,684
()

39
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:11,191
Um.

40
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,031
Bless you.

41
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,339
()

42
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,974
(Let me) come back next to you.

43
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:29,642
Fuck.

44
00:03:30,009 --> 00:03:30,376
()

45
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:33,913
Oh.

46
00:03:33,913 --> 00:03:34,948
((laughs))

47
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:36,683
Ah, it’s okay.

48
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:48,428
What's this?

49
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:06,613
Alright.

50
00:04:09,482 --> 00:04:10,216
()

51
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:31,170
What happened?

52
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:46,586
Yeah yeah yeah.

53
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:57,630
Uh.

54
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:04,270
Try (hitting) -- try hitting the camera with um the purple thing, maybe.

55
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:12,278
If you direct the camera towards the portal with the purple ... uh gun, it might open up a portal.

56
00:05:22,355 --> 00:05:22,689
Oh.

57
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:32,532
Ah, oh.

58
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,047
Mm.

59
00:06:04,063 --> 00:06:05,998
Mhm, oh can you hold this door for me?

60
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:16,109
()

61
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:18,578
()

62
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,989
Okay, I put a portal here.

63
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:37,463
Okay.

64
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,259
How did this open?

65
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:11,697
Nice.

66
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:16,169
Yeah.

67
00:07:18,137 --> 00:07:18,905
Ugh.

68
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,078
Well, this is kind of fun.
