Huh.

6
00:00:15,048 --> 00:00:16,583
There's a portal here.

7
00:00:17,283 --> 00:00:19,219
I can place one to see what happens.

8
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:23,790
And uh ... this one here.

9
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:26,526
Can see what it does.

10
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,894
Does it do anything?

11
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:32,332
Oh.

12
00:00:32,632 --> 00:00:33,933

The hatch get opened over there, but I don't really know what --

17
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:46,579
Oh, let me see.

18
00:00:47,914 --> 00:00:48,281

19
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:49,682

25
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,059

26
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,260
Maybe no.

27
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,294

Uh.

30
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:11,137
I guess this is for the researchers to like synchronize the -- the recording so, but you can ask them, I guess.

31
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:12,605
Anyway.

Uh, anyway  I --

The purple one.

61
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:08,261
You can go through the portal right now.

62
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:11,664
The -- the -- the -- my blue portal.

63
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:11,931
Yeah.

64
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,734
The portal that is behind you.

65
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:17,637
Yeah, (you’re) -- you're looking at the right direction, and you can come through.

66
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:18,371
Cool.

67
00:02:19,172 --> 00:02:19,939

00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:23,910
Yeah, and uh --

70
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:27,914
Hm, let me see what this place is for.

71
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,216
Uh, do you think there's a -- 

72
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:31,551
I don't know.

73
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:32,385
What -- what does this mean?

74
00:02:33,753 --> 00:02:34,020
Oh.

75
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,856

What's this do?

77
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,197
Agh, let me see.

78
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:46,266
Hm.

79
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:48,134
Got confused.

80
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,339
Press, press, press, press. 

81
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:54,674
Press.

82
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:56,042
Press.

83
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,278
Uh, nothing really happened.

84
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,113
Oh, look at -- look up there.

85
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:00,813
Uh.

86
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:03,016
Before we press the button -- 

87
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:03,383
Um.

88
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:04,617
All four like -- 

89
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,021
Oh yeah, did you see the like -- the color changes?

90
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:14,961
If we press the button, (this uh) color is going to change from -- from uh -- from blue to orange over there

91
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,262
Right.

92
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:19,599
So maybe we should find the next two one.

93
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,902
The -- the two ones should be somewhere inside so -- 

94
00:03:23,736 --> 00:03:24,037
Hm.

95
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:26,172
Uh.

96
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,609
Oh I see we can place a portal up there.

97
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:32,345
And you can place a portal there.

98
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:36,149
Uh you -- you place -- I place a portal there so --

99
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,218
(Sorry), did you see my portal?

100
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:40,086
Up -- up here.

101
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,222
You can place it to the like -- there.

102
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:43,323
On the left side.

103
00:03:43,489 --> 00:03:46,426
Yeah, and uh we can place another portal to get inside.

104
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:48,361
Have to do it quick though though.

105
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,730
We have to synchronize our moves.

106
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,633
There’s -- there ain't much time for us to like uh --

107
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,636
Yeah, and I've got to --

108
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:59,305
Uh and press that one.

109
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,375
And uh press this one.

110
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:04,911
Uh (something) -- something's failing.

111
00:04:05,345 --> 00:04:05,745
Oof.

112
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,247
Let's synchronize our move.

113
00:04:07,313 --> 00:04:09,549
Let's get to a closest button.

114
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,950
We press the first button.

115
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:18,825
Like, on my mark, we press the button, we get into the portal, we press another button, and we rush to the (finish) -- rush to the door.

116
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,026
The hatch over there, right?

117
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:22,395
Cool.

118
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:23,730
Did you like --

119
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,666
Three, two, one, on my mark, go.

120
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:27,734
(Let's) -- let's do this.

121
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:35,742
Here, let's press one button and press the other one, and try to ... press the third, maybe.

122
00:04:36,542 --> 00:04:37,243
And uh --

123
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:37,844
Oof.

124
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:42,215
Yeah, and uh now we can stand here, I guess.

125
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,650
Something's out.

126
00:04:44,617 --> 00:04:45,518
Did you see that?

127
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:48,688
Yeah.

128
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,658
So, what is this?

129
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:54,527
Oh, we might have to put the ball on it, I guess.

130
00:04:55,395 --> 00:04:56,162
We can like (drop) --

131
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:56,996
Yeah.

132
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:01,301
Damn, this game is -- I don't know.

133
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,235
Can I interact?

134
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,770
Oh, I can use interact!

135
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:10,410
If I press E, I can, like, put this up and uh drop this to the ... desired location.

136
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,511
And uh here we go.

137
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:13,713
That's cool.

138
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:16,582
That's cool.

139
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,685
((hums))

140
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:21,220
Yeah, nice.
